# The Salem Witch Trails  ðŸ§™
Similar to the game The Oregon Trail, this is a text based adventure game, in which the player is a witch trying to survive during a time of mass execution in America. This game the player and her coven must go on through the year like normal without causing any suspicions that may lead to them getting killed. 
# The History ðŸ“–
The Salem Witch trials took place in Colonial Massachusetts, in 1692 and lasted all the way up until 1693. During this time 14 women and 5 men were burned, hung and/or stoned to death, and each of those deaths happened on one of these three dates: July 19, August 19, and September 22. These trials were a result of a mass hysterical that consumed the town at the time, but the reasons behind this hysteria are speculated to have resulted from fear and boredom, with the fear mainly resulting from strongly held Puritan beliefs. All and all the hysteria was caused mostly by unfounded fearsâ€¦mostly
# How to Play the Game ðŸŽ®
Youâ€™ll find that to play the game it is very similar to playing the game The Oregon Trail, it is a text base choose your own adventure game, you just have to lay through the game and make it through the year making decisions and choosing what you do, but be careful of what you do! Anything could raise suspicion and result in you being accused of being a witch!

# There's always room for improvement!
The game is a little long and a little boring, which could easily be fixed and I have some ideas on how, I was thinking that maybe the add_day(0 function could add more days at a time, but with the time given I couldn't figure out how to have it go by faster and hit all the speical dates I wanted, so maybe I have it so it randomly skips certain days, just to help the game move along. Another thing that I think could be more interesting would be for there to be town hall meetins every month to disscuse more of what's going on in the town, and going off of that i feel like if I could add some more characters and activities it would be a wholelot more fun, but all in all I'm still very rpoud of my game.

With the help of Brad Teaches on Youtube and his coding tutorials I was able to leaen how to code a text base game very simply:
